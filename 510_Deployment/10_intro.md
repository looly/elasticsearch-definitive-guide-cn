If you have made it this far in the book, hopefully you've learned a thing or
two about Elasticsearch and are ready to((("deployment"))) deploy your cluster to production.((("clusters", "deployment", see="deployment")))
This chapter is not meant to be an exhaustive guide to running your cluster
in production, but it covers the key things to consider before putting
your cluster live.

Three main areas are covered:

- Logistical considerations, such as hardware recommendations and deployment
strategies
- Configuration changes that are more suited to a production environment
- Post-deployment considerations, such as security, maximizing indexing performance,
and backups


当你看到此处时，希望已经较好的掌握了Elasticsearch，并且准备将集群部署到生产环境。本章不打算对如何部署集群到生产环境做一个详尽的指南，只是涉及几个集群上线前需要考虑的关键点。
主要包括以下三个方面：
- 后勤方面的考虑，例如硬件准备和部署策略
- 符合集群环境的配置更改
- 部署后的考虑，例如安全，最大索引性能，以及备份
